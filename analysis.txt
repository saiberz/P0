# Student provides a text file accurately explaining their run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) for each solution they produced.

## Consideration: For big O analysis I'm considering n as the number of text and calls

## Task 0

In order to get the value knowing the index the has a constant value
Complexity O(1)

## Task 1

In order to get all the phones we need to iterate both lists and get the phone number 
Complexity O(n)

## Task 2

In order to get the longest time we need to iterate throught both lists to create a dictionary with the accumulated for each number(complexity O(n)) then we need to iterate through that list to get the maxium value(complexity O(n))
Complexity O(n)

## Task 3

Part A:

In order to get the numbers called by people from people in Bangalore we need to iterate trough the list of calls and accumulate them in a list, as this results are not sortered we need to sort it using built in sort function which has O(nlogn) complexity which is worse than O(n) from loop 
Complexity O(nlogn)

Part B:
From above we get a list of phones made to other fixed Bangalore numbers and a list of calls made from Bangalore to non fixed Bangalore numbers, on this step we are joining two lists(complexity O(n)) so complexity for this part is given from sorting in previous step which is worse than O(n)
Complexity O(nlogn)


## Task 4
In order to get the possible telemarketer numbers we need to generate sets, one with all possible telemarketing numbers(which could be any number that has made at least one call) and the other with all numbers that meet the condition of not being a telemarketing number(whic at least have received a call or have received/sent a text), when we have both sets we only need to make a difference of both sets and we have the results.
For average case complexity of difference of sets is O(len(caller_numbers)) and compared with sorted(O(nlogn)) then complexity for this problem would be O(nlogn)
For worst case complexity of difference of sets(what I could find investigating) is O(n^2) and compared with sorted function O(nlogn) we can conclude complexity for this problem would be O(n^2)
